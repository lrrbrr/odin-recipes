        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <body>
                <ul>
                    <li>store-bought dough (any type works as long as it's not sweet)</li>
                    <li>3 to 4 medium-sized eggs</li>
                    <li>milk (up to 500 mL)</li>
                    <li>grated cheese, any kind works</li>
                    <li>salt, pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>spices and herbs (optional)</li>
                    <li>... and whichever veggie and protein you decide to use for your variation-of-the-day</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk the eggs energetically, should look foamy</li>
                    <li>Add in the milk, until mid-liquidy</li>
                    <li>Add in the veggies, sauteed before-hand if necessary</li>
                    <li>Add spices, herbs and grated cheese</li>
                    <li>Cover the mold with the store-bought dough, poke holes with a fork to avoid bubbles</li>
                    <li>Pour in the liquid mix</li>
                    <li>Bake for up to 30 minutes, until the dough and top looks golden at 200 degrees Celsius</li>
                </ol>

        <h4>Pro-tip:</h4>
                    Try any flavor and don't be afraid to experiment. Caramelized onions are a great touch!
